# Palworld Helm Chart

This chart installs [docker-palworld-dedicated-server](https://github.com/jammsen/docker-palworld-dedicated-server) on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh/) package manager.

## Usage

Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:
